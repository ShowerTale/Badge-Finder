# ShowerTale's Badge Finder
## Setup
### Step 1: Basic installation
Install all files in this GitHub (and put them in a folder), npm, and Visual Studio Code (which will be referred to it's acronym from now on; VSC) if you haven't already.
### Step 2: Open the folder and install modules
Open up your folder within VSC.
Then, make a new terminal by going to Terminal (at the top) > New Terminal.
Lastly, run "npm install" inside of the Terminal.
Don't close the terminal yet as you will need it for later.
### Step 3: Set your settings
Open the JavaScript file called "script.js". This is the main script that will find the badges for you.
At the top, there will be a comment saying "Settings," and a lot of const(ant) variables. Just set the varaiables to your needs (with the help of the comments).
Make ABSOLUTELY SURE to set the first variable (const UserId) at the top to YOUR user id (you can find tutorials on how to get your id if you don't know how), otherwise the script WILL NOT WORK!
### Step 4: Run the script
In order to run the script, simply run either "node script.js" OR "npm start".
### Step 5: Enjoy your badges!
Hooray! You can now find any badge you want with ease.
If you ever want to stop the script, simply press Control + C or delete the terminal.
